Bagging is one of the core principles of random forests. In bagging several models are trained and for each model only a subset 
of the training observations is used to train the model. 
The subsets can be drawn in different ways:

* For each model draw randomly observations with replacement
* For each model draw randomly observations without replacement
* Divide the training dataset into several subsets and train each model with a different subset

Furthermore the number of observations that is drawn for each model has to be specified.
